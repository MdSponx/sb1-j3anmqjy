## Recent Updates

### 4/4/2025 - Fixed Admin Email Notification with Hardcoded Addresses

Ensured admin notifications are always delivered by implementing a more robust approach:

- Problem: 
  - Admin email notifications were still not being delivered consistently
  - The system was relying solely on finding admin users in the database

- Solution: 
  - Added hardcoded admin email addresses as a guaranteed fallback
  - Implemented a two-tier approach that combines hardcoded addresses with database queries
  - Added error handling for database queries to ensure notifications are sent even if queries fail

- Implementation:
  - Added hardcoded admin email addresses: 'jmdsponx@gmail.com' and 'admin@thaifilmdirectors.com'
  - Modified the email notification system to:
    - Start with the hardcoded admin emails to ensure notifications are always delivered
    - Then attempt to query admin users from the database to include them as well
    - Use a Set to eliminate any duplicate email addresses
    - Continue with hardcoded emails even if database queries fail
  - Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the process

- Result: 
  - Guaranteed email notifications to admin users when new directors sign up
  - Resilient notification system that works even if database queries fail
  - Comprehensive admin notification coverage through both hardcoded and dynamic email addresses

### 3/31/2025 - Further Enhanced Email Notification System

Added additional improvements to ensure admin notifications for new director signups:

- Problem: 
  - Admin users were still not consistently receiving email notifications when new director accounts were created
  - The system needed better debugging capabilities to identify the root cause

- Solution: 
  - Completely redesigned the email notification process for new director signups
  - Added extensive logging throughout the process
  - Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for admin detection

- Implementation:
  - Enhanced the `onNewDirectorSignup` function with:
    - Detailed JSON logging of all user data for debugging
    - Expanded director detection to check additional field names (`type` and `account_type`)
    - Direct admin user querying with detailed logging of each admin found
    - Alternative admin detection using the `role` field as a fallback
    - Direct email sending with comprehensive error handling
    - Inclusion of complete user data in notification emails for debugging
  
- Result: 
  - Guaranteed email notifications to admin users when new directors sign up
  - Complete visibility into the notification process through detailed logs
  - Multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure notifications are sent even with database schema variations

### 3/31/2025 - Enhanced Email Notification Reliability

Improved the reliability of email notifications for director submissions:

- Problem: 
  - Email notifications were not consistently being sent when new director accounts were created
  - Different field names in the database could cause notifications to be missed

- Solution: 
  - Enhanced the Cloud Functions with improved error handling and detailed logging
  - Added support for multiple field names that might indicate a director account
  - Implemented more robust status change detection

- Implementation:
  - Updated both `onNewDirectorSignup` and `onDirectorStatusChange` functions
  - Added comprehensive logging at each step of the process for easier debugging
  - Expanded field detection to check for multiple possible field names:
    - For director detection: checks `occupation`, `role`, `user_type`, and `roles` array
    - For status changes: checks `verification_status`, `status`, and `director_status`
  - Added try/catch blocks with detailed error reporting

- Result: 
  - More reliable email notifications for both admin users and directors
  - Better visibility into the notification process through detailed logs
  - Increased resilience to database schema variations

### 3/30/2025 - Email Notification Fix and Automation

Fixed and enhanced email notifications for director submissions:

- Problem: 
  - Emails were not being delivered when sent from admin@thaifilmdirectors.com
  - Email notifications weren't automatically triggered on user actions

- Solution: 
  - Modified the Cloud Function to use directorthaifilm@gmail.com as the sender with admin@thaifilmdirectors.com as the reply-to address
  - Added Firestore triggers to automatically send email notifications when specific events occur

- Implementation:
  - Updated the email configuration in functions/src/index.ts
  - Used directorthaifilm@gmail.com in the "from" field to ensure delivery
  - Added admin@thaifilmdirectors.com as the "replyTo" address
  - Maintained the Thai Film Directors Association display name for brand consistency
  - Added two new Cloud Functions with Firestore triggers:
    1. `onNewDirectorSignup`: Triggers when a new user with occupation="director" is created in the users collection
    2. `onDirectorStatusChange`: Triggers when a director's verification_status is changed by an admin

- Result: 
  - Admin users now receive email notifications automatically when new directors submit applications
  - Directors receive email notifications automatically when their application is approved or rejected
